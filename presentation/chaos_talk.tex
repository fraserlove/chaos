    \section{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Good afternoon. My name is Fraser Love for my BSc Honours project I have been investigating Chaos in Topological Dynamical Systems.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Table of Contents}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this presentation I will first give the definition of a topological dynamical system.
        \item Then I will introduce some basic topological dynamics and give examples of such systems.
        \item Next I will discuss what exactly it means to be chaotic, before giving a formal definition of some of these characteristics.
        \item Next I shall introduce the most widely accepted definition of chaos called Devaney chaos and explore some consequences of this definition. \item Finally we shall conclude the presentation by using propositions we have developed to prove that a specific topological dynamical system called the shift map is chaotic.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Dynamical System Definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firstly, what is a dynamical system?
    \end{itemize}
