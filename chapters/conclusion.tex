Make a layout of different topological systems we have been studying, their properties and the different types of chaos they exhibit
- Link all the different types of chaos together, and show the strongest and weakest definitions.
- Give opinion into best definition and why that is


Then redo abstract, introduction and beginning of chapter 3 to wewrite in topological entropy and chaos
